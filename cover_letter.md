# Cover Letter

My name is Daniel, I am a Software Developer from Austria - and I would love to work at your core team. :)

I love to code. Every since I got my first PC I have been coding, trying out things and learning. I am passionate about understanding things, concepts, ways of working - in order to reflect on them to make them better. I am also very curious and love to try to see every angle of a topic. My highly analytical mind is a great help in achieving what I take on. A usual workflow of mine includes the need to understand the problem: I investigate the topic, its history and possible issues. After building the knowledge I can either propose possible alternative ways or solutions to a given problem or implement them myself. I am a big fan of working in an agile environment, as it helps to focus on the stuff that is really important.

During the past three years in my former job I have been working closely with our in-house software-architect to rebuild our more-than-a-decade old core libraries. There were plenty of challenges: besides working through the dusty code, it also took a lot of social skills. Many of my colleagues have been working in the same manner for years without giving thought about different perspectives. Preparing the team to be comfortable with changes and raising awareness of the importance of these changes was an interesting and demanding, yet fulfilling task. During my time in the team I was able to bring in some new ideas and concepts, including CI/CD, a Core library overhaul and the implementation of regular Developer talks in which Developers would give a short presentation on recent topics.

With the beginning of 2020 I took a timeout from my corporate job to pursue my passion of making games. I still am very passionate about this path but I would also like to evolve further as a programmer as I thorougly enjoy working on core concepts and functionalities.
I have known Unity as a game engine for some time but have been using it more frequently since this year. That is one reason why I would like to contribute to your product. I can see the impact Unity has on developers - pros and amateurs alike. I can relate to users and to requirements users might pose aswell as to the developers and their complex workflows for providing features. In my former job I worked on tools and products I could not identify with. Working on the Unity game engine would be very rewarding.
On a more personal level, I am planning to move to Copenhagen with my fiance in the forseeable future, as part of my family already lives there and we have felt very much at home during our last few visits. This poses the opportunity to look for a job in the Copenhagen region - your job offer stood out for me for the given reasons.

Role description
Unity is the worldâ€™s leading real-time 3D development platform that enables our users to create, operate and monetize their content. At Unity we believe the world is a better place with more creators in it. We solve hard problems so that our users can focus on their creations.

In Core we are looking for engineers that love solving complex problems. In our view, solving complex problems requires a desire to understand, creativity, certain risk taking and the ability to talk to other human beings in a humble manner. It also requires being able to take decisions, iterate, work with feedback and learning.

We are transitioning from object oriented programming and rebuilding the core foundation of Unity with the high-performance multithreaded Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS).

Core is a part of R&D and we are looking for senior engineers to be based in Copenhagen to work with us on initiatives around On Demand Asset Pipeline, Prefabs, Scripting and DOTS.

Develop tools, real time editing and perform engine programming with quality and performance in mind
Organize cross department/group teams to successfully solve internal and customer problems
Provide Technical direction including tools, rendering and infrastructure
Requirements

Problem solving skills
Programming skills (C++ and C# are a bonus) and architectural awareness
Strong collaboration and communication skills (English is our primary language)
Comfort to operate in a flat hierarchy and a networked organisation where information is pulled not pushed

Bonus points

Prior experience with the Unity engine
Understanding the challenges of real-time 3D and the scalability and performance it requires
Understanding of large code bases and desire to solve the challenges it can bring
Desire to drive initiatives
